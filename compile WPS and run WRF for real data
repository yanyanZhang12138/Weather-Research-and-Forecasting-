Task a:Compile WPS

build serial WPS using Intel compiler 

Tips: we use GRIB2 data and need the following libraries: JasPer, libPNG, and Zlib. Some of these libraries may be available on Scholar already. 
a
Please download WPS 3.9.1 from UCAR website and compile it on Scholar.

Pre-processing

Task: Pre-process the raw data and get ready for wrf run

Inside the top-level directory of WPS suite,

•	Link to NAM grib files
./link_grib.csh /directory/nam

•	make sure you have Vtable and namelist.input, make updates if needed.

•	Prepare a job script to run the pre-processing steps in the scholar queue.
1.	Run geogrid.exe
2.	Run ungrib.exe
3.	Run metgrid.exe 
After the job is done, you will find the log file for each step as well as the several netcdf files (.nc files)

scripts for running wps:
#!/bin/sh -l
#PBS -q yourwueuename
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=20:walltime=30:00
#PBS -N wps_pre-processing
#PBS -m abe
#PBS -M *YOUREMAILADDRESS*

module load netcdf
module load hdf5
module load intel

NP=$PBS_NP
cd *yourcurrentpath*

./geogrid.exe >& log.geogrid
./ungrib.exe >& log.ungrib
./metgrid.exe >& log.metgrid

after running, the *.exe files, log.* files FILE:* files and *.nc files should be generated.

Task b: WRF runs
WRF runs

Task: Perform weather modeling with wrf for real data
Cd ..
Inside of the top-level directory of WRF suite

•	Copy the existing run directory to a new location, for example: cp -a run run_20190219
•	Copy the netcdf files from the pre-processing step 
• Make sure you update namelist.input is needed.

•	Prepare a job script to run weather modeling in parallel with two nodes in scholar queue.
1.	Run real.exe
2.	Run wrf.exe

script for running real.exe and wrf.exe
#!/bin/sh -l
#PBS -q *yourqueuename*
#PBS -l nodes=2:ppn=20,walltime=04:00:00
#PBS -N wrfjob
#PBS -m abe
#PBS -M *YOUREMAIL*


module load intel/17.0.1.132
module load impi/2017.1.132
module load netcdf/4.5.0

NP=$PBS_NP
cd *yourcurrentdirectory8

mpirun -np $NP./real.exe
mpirun -np $NP ./wrf.exe

after running, rsl.error* files, rsl.out.* files and wrfout files files should be generated.
It takes around three hours to run.
